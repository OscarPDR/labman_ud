# Introduction

This project is designed to help research centers organize and expose their information in an understandable and simple way. It also allows to easily publish this information as Linked Open Data, using some well known vocabularies to allow other researchers query the data through a SPARQL Endpoint.

**labman_ud** is developed using [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), a MVT (Model-View-Template) Python Web Framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

A whole example can be consulted at [MORElab's homepage](http://www.morelab.deusto.es/), a research group within [Deustotech](http://www.deustotech.deusto.es/), [Deusto](http://www.deusto.es/) Institute of Technology, where this project was initially designed and developed in the spare time of some of its components.
